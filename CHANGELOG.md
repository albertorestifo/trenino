# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Output configuration UI for LEDs and indicators
  - Add/delete outputs with pin number (0-255) and optional name
  - Test buttons to toggle outputs on/off when device is connected
  - Outputs are controlled via SetOutput commands (not stored on device)

### Fixed

- Allow pin 0 to be selected when configuring analog and button inputs (pin 0 is a valid Arduino pin)
- Fix firmware upload crash when avrdude is not installed (now shows proper error message)
- Fix firmware upload on Windows for Pro Micro/Leonardo boards (detect bootloader on new COM port after 1200bps touch)
- Fix slow device reconnection after firmware upload (was waiting 30s backoff, now reconnects immediately)
- Fix config_id being regenerated when applying saved configuration (now preserves the existing config_id)
- Fix slow page transitions when simulator is disconnected (connection retries are now async)
